# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Movies To Watch
Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP1804/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: _Jiale Hou_

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
`movies.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
`movies_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used...    
This is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it again.

This is the movie to watch python program by Jiale Hou from CP 1404. This program allows you 
to load movie information from a file in to the python list for further modification.
In the program follow the menu instruction, you can check the movie information, or change the movie
status, and add new movies you would like to watch.
Finally, when you press 'Q' button on your keyboard, this will end the program and save the updated
movie information in the csv file again.

> I spend around 30 hours on this assignment.


2. What do you plan to do  differently in your development process for assignment 2?
> I will make a better design, and set up a better plan before I start coding the actual
> program.
